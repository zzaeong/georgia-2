                        impaired people by establishing a separate facility in Georgia where visually impaired people can use various<br>

                        1. The Georgia Information Access Center (IAC) is interested in in information education<br>
                        and projects for the disabled, and is continuing to communicate with Elbitech, a smart tech<br>
                        company for the disabled, in its own language.
                        <br><br>
                        2. The Information Access Center, located in the Mirza Gelovani Youth Library, provided<br>
                        education not only for teenagers, the main users, but also for those who completed the<br>
                        government-run Training of Trainers (TOT) program. The TOT program is a training program run<br>
                        by the Georgia Department of Economic Development and Sustainable Growth and the Georgia<br>
                        Innovation and Technology Agency (GITA), aimed at producing 40,000 ICT experts by 2020. To<br>
                        this end, Georgia has conducted HELP trainer training since 2017.<br>
                        Participants in the TOT program have various occupational groups such as prosecutors and<br>
                        judges, and as a result of the program's operation, they were able to learn how to use<br>
                        adult learning technology and how to use an electronic learning platform.

                        IAC Georgia is conducting a project with the Republic of Korea to build a pilot class using<br>
                        advanced ICT in 2024. On July 10-15, 2022, a South Korean delegation visited Georgia to meet<br>
                        with Georgia's Vice Education Minister Valerian Gobronizé, and discussed plans for the<br>
                        feasibility study of the project and future cooperation measures. In addition, Ambassador<br>
                        Chung Dae-soo met with the delegation and said he expected the project to be successful and<br>
                        follow-up educational cooperation projects between Korea and Georgia will also be completed.
