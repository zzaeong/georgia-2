                        8. Disabled persons are entitled to have their special needs taken into<br>
                        consideration at all stages of economic and social planning.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        9. Disabled persons have the right to live with their families or with foster<br>
                        parents and to participate in all social, creative or recreational activities. No disabled person shall be<br>
                        subjected, as far as his or her residence is concerned, to differential treatment other than that required<br>
                        by his or her condition or by the improvement which he or she may derive therefrom. If the stay of a disabled<br>
                        person in a specialized establishment is indispensable, the environment and living conditions therein shall be<br>
                        as close as possible to those of the normal life of a person of his or her age.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        10. Disabled persons shall be protected against all exploitation, all regulations and all treatment of a<br>
                        discriminatory, abusive or degrading nature.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        11. Disabled persons shall be able to avail themselves of qualified legal aid when such aid proves indispensable<br>
                        for the protection of their persons and property. If judicial proceedings are instituted against them, the legal<br>
                        procedure applied shall take their physical and mental condition fully into account.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        12. Organizations of disabled persons may be usefully consulted in all matters regarding the rights of disabled persons.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        13. Disabled persons, their families and communities shall be fully informed, by all appropriate means, of the rights<br>
                        contained in this Declaration.<br>
